# Raffle Block #

Randomly select one from a group of options.

## Developer Mode ##

## Super-Secret Cheat Mode ##

(Please use this responsibly.) If `WP_DEBUG` is set, then the super-secret cheat mode can be activated, which will heavily bias the selection process in favor of the first item in the list.
